    "__Introduction__ <br>\n",
    "WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. The account was started in 2015 by college student Matt Nelson and has, as of October 2022, 9.3 million followers. Within the first 2 years the account reached 3 million followers which was followed by the publication of a book named “#WeRateDogs: The Most Hilarious and Adorable Pups You’ve Ever Seen”, in the fall of 2017$^{1}$. This articles looks into the most common tweeted dog breeds and most popular tweets posted during these first two years after foundation, from November 2015 till August 2017. But first, what rating system does WeRateDogs apply and to what extent does a dog's rating says something about its favourability? <br>"

    "__The rating system of WeRateDogs__ <br>\n",
    "The rating system of WeRateDogs is somewhat unusual in the sense that it, on a 1-to-10 scale, allows ratings exceeding 10 (e.g. 12/10). In fact, based on data from 2015-2017, ratings above 10/10 are, with 75%, more common than ratings of 10/10 or below. The lowest rating given is 0, the highest rating 14/10 and the most common rating is 12/10. While the most liked tweets generally concern highly rated dogs, the two are not correlated. That is, higher rated dogs don't necessarily receive more likes. <br>"
