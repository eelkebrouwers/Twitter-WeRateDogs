In fact, based on data from 2015-2017, ratings above 10/10 are, with 75%, more common than ratings of 10/10 or below. The lowest rating given is 0, the highest rating 14/10 and the most common rating is 12/10. While the most liked tweets generally concern highly rated dogs, the two are not correlated. That is, higher rated dogs don't necessarily receive more likes. <br>
